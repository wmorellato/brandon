# Python Builder

The Python builder is maintained by the authors of Brandon and provides a basic CLI Python boilerplate. The project can also be extended to serve a REST API or a library.

## Project Structure

Below is the project structure generated by this builder. Command groups will have separate files for themselves under the `cli` directory, and are imported by the `main` module. Dependencies are specified in the `pyproject.toml` file, together with the name of the executable to be installed and other metadata.

```
{app}-{version}
├── {app}
│   ├── cli
│   │   ├── {group1}.py
|   |   ├── {group2}.py
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── schemas.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── tests
```

## Dependencies

The command line parser library used in this builder is [Click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/), which is currently set to version `8.1`. 

The packaging and dependency management is done using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## Naming Conventions

The following naming conventions were used when generating the stub. Characters that don't comply with the naming convention will be removed when reading the specification file.
